##### Description : Make an ECG measuring instrument, measure and record the ECG directly. In this case, the current weather information and location information of the location measured through web crawling and gps are recorded together to check whether there is a correlation with the electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram measured in this way is stored and retrieved through aws, and shows the graph, weather, and location in ui. ECG information is managed for each user and users are classified through login.
